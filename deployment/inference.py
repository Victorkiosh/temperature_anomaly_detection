    Runs hybrid anomaly detection on a single temperature reading.

    Steps:
    1. Scale input using the same scaler from training.
    2. Use the LSTM model to reconstruct the reading.
    3. Compute reconstruction error (difference between actual and predicted).
    4. Compare error to a statistical threshold.
    5. Apply persistence filter: require N consecutive anomalies.
    6. Apply absolute temperature bounds.
    7. Combine both (hybrid) to decide whether to raise an alert.

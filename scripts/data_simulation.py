1_data_simulation.py
--------------------
This script generates synthetic temperature and humidity readings 
for a cold storage facility. The data simulates 8 rooms across 
different temperature zones (frozen, chilled, ambient) with 
measurements recorded every 15 minutes for one week.

Output:
    - A CSV file named 'simulated_sensor_data.csv' containing:
        timestamp, room_name, temperature, humidity

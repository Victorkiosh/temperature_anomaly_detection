4_data_verification.py
-----------------------

Verifies that the simulated sensor data has been successfully inserted into
the SQLite database.

Performs:
    1. Record count checks for each table.
    2. Sampling a few entries from sensor_readings.
    3. Viewing the most recent system log messages.

This script is purely for validation and quality assurance.
